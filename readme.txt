== Description ==

### WOOCOMMERCE HIMALAYAN BANK PAYMENT GATEWAY PLUGIN

Accept the Himalayan Bank payment from your store.

[Himalayan Bank Limited](https://www.himalayanbank.com/) is one of the largest private banks of Nepal. If you do not know about the Himalayan Bank, you probably do not need this plugin.

You can follow the [documentation](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/accept-himalayan-bank-payment-from-your-woocommerce-site/) and see live demo on [Woolmandu](https://woolmandu.com/).

The plugin is developed without any incentive from the Himlayan Bank or WooCommerce.
